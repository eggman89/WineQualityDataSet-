# Wine Quality Data Set
A simple but fun program that let's you predict the class of the wine depending on the dataset. The dataset is tried and test on 5 MLlib algorithms and it shows you the execution time and prediction accuracy for each algorithm.

It's possible to get far more result using the library attributes. The results from my experiments are stored in the results folder.
